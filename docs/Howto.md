# How to implement VLC(verifiable logical clock) with Nostr protocol

### Add Nip3041 Feature
For applying the clock in Nostr, we designed a NIP feature which can use the verifiable 
logical clock as a "time unit" in a poll event at the background of distributed
system.

### Add Zchronod Layer In The Relay Layer
For broadcasting and using the state of the relative clock, we added Zchronod layer, 
Zchronod is a novel logical clock system that targets an open and decentralized network

### Modifications To Nostr Relay
###WIP
